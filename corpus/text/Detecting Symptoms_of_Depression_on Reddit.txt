ABSTRACT
Depression is known to have heterogeneous symptom manifesta-
tions. Investigating various symptoms of depression is essential
to understanding underlying mechanisms and personalizing treat-
ments. Reddit, an online peer-to-peer social media platform, con-
tains varied communities (subreddits) where individuals discuss
their detailed mental health experiences and seek support. The cur-
rent paper has two aims. The first is to identify psycho-linguistic
and open-vocabulary language markers associated with different
symptoms using 1,318,749 posts from 43 subreddit communities
(e.g., r/bingeeating) clustered into 13 expert-validated depression
symptoms (e.g., disordered eating). The second aim is to develop pre-
diction models based on the above linguistic features and RoBERTa
embeddings to detect specific symptom discourse in contrast to
control subreddit posts contributed by the same Reddit users. These
predictive models are then validated on a second sample of individ-
uals (N = 2,986) who shared their Facebook posts and completed
self-report depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and loneliness
(UCLA-3) surveys.
Based on the differential linguistic patterns that emerged across
the various symptoms in our data, we identified three potential clus-
ters, which could also be mapped to the Research Domain Criteria
(RDoC) framework. RoBERTa embeddings demonstrated the high-
est accuracy at predicting most symptoms and were particularly
robust at predicting the severity of suicidal thoughts and attempts,
self-loathing, loneliness, and disordered eating. Our study demon-
strates the potential of using large, pseudonymous online forums to
train language-based symptom-estimation machine-learning mod-
els that can be applied to other text sources. Such technologies could
be helpful in clinical psychology, population health, and other areas
where early mental health monitoring could improve diagnosis,
risk reduction, and treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders world-
wide, ranking among the leading causes of disease burden [57].
At least 5% of adults worldwide suffer from depression at some
point in their lives [45]. Natural language processing (NLP) of
social media data has been utilized to characterize and predict
depression [13, 19, 30]. However, prior research in this area has pre-
dominantly treated depression as a single syndrome, for instance,
represented by a sum-score [23].
Depression is a complex condition with varied clinical presenta-
tions and manifestations that can be experienced as distinct individ-
ual symptoms [60]. For instance, one study identified 52 individual
symptoms of depression, including sadness, suicidal ideation, and
fatigue [21]. Understanding the heterogeneity across individual
symptoms can provide valuable insights [24]. Profiling the symp-
toms of depression is essential for exploring causal mechanisms
and developing personalized interventions. Specific symptoms of
depression may be linked to different risk factors [28] and biomark-
ers [60], and may also respond differently to antidepressant treat-
ments [8]. For example, a study on 7,500 pairs of twins identified
three underlying genetic factors for the nine symptomatic criteria
of DSM major depression [37]. Furthermore, particular life events
(e.g., romantic breakup) can predict increases in specific symptoms
of depression [24]. Such differences across specific symptoms of
depression reflect the importance of characterizing each symptom
for accurate prediction.

WebSci ‚Äô23, April 30‚ÄìMay 01, 2023, Austin, TX, USA
Recent studies of depression using social media language have
investigated specific symptoms [64, 65]. Despite this progress, cer-
tain challenges remain - first, studies often lack solid validation for
the classification models (e.g., clinical assessments) or rely solely
on dimensions from one inventory, typically the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9 [38]). Although the PHQ-9 is based on DSM
criteria [38], with anhedonia and depressed mood being core symp-
toms, depression often presents in various ways beyond the nine
symptoms in PHQ-9 [22]. For example, many scales overlook so-
matic symptoms, which can lead to significant distress and influ-
ence depression diagnosis [24]. Thus, an additional challenge is to
consider more relevant symptoms instead of translating directly
from the DSM-5 criteria when characterizing depression. The third
challenge is the high cost of collecting self-reported symptom-
level depression data to build language-based prediction models. To
achieve the necessary statistical power, large sample sizes are often
required [18]. Given the complexity of depression symptoms and
measurements [22], advancing precision prediction of depression
at the symptom level at low costs is crucial.
In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps in recent studies of depres-
sion using social media language by analyzing the heterogeneous
symptoms of depression from Reddit and validating our predic-
tions using additional Facebook language data from out-of-sample
user data with self-reported depression, anxiety, and loneliness
assessments. To provide clinically valuable insights for depression
assessment at the symptom level [47], we summarize and validate
the 13 symptoms from the seven most commonly used measure-
ments of depression [21], with the help of clinical experts (see
Table 1 for the list of symptoms). Reddit is an apt data source for
this study due to its unique affordances, including anonymity and
sub-communities where individuals discuss their mental health
experiences and seek support. For an overview of our study, please
refer to Figure 1.
The major contributions of this paper are threefold:
‚Ä¢ We identify the differential linguistic markers for 13 expert-
validated symptoms of depression using Reddit posts.
‚Ä¢ We showcase the ability of Reddit posts to predict specific
symptoms of depression across various linguistic models.
‚Ä¢ We validate the predictive models trained on Reddit on out-
of-sample individuals who consented to share self-report
surveys and Facebook posts.

RELATED WORK
2.1
Depression and Social Media Language
Social media language has been found to reflect individuals‚Äô daily
lives and mental status, providing valuable insights into mental
health predictions [40]. Among all mental health conditions, depres-
sion is most commonly researched using social media [10]. Past
studies have successfully used social media language to predict
depression (see reviews in [26, 30, 34, 55]). For example, one of
the most cited papers extracted linguistic features from Twitter
to analyze depression [13] and found signals for characterizing
the onset of depression (e.g., increased negative emotions). The
most commonly used linguistic features or variables in predictive
analyses include the distribution of words and phrases, the syn-
tactic composition of posts (e.g., length of posts), psycholinguistic

Markers of Depression Symptoms.
categories from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
dictionaries [48], Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics [7], and
domain-specific lexicons (see reviews in [10, 53]). These features
are typically used to correlate and classify depression status ob-
tained through self-assessments, self-disclosure, or forum mem-
bership [30]. Although some studies have evaluated the predictive
ability of language posted on Reddit about multiple mental health
conditions [12, 36], specific symptoms of depression have not been
examined. Common self-assessments in these analyses include the
PHQ-9 [38], the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
Revised (CES-D [17]), and Beck‚Äôs Depression Inventory (BDI, [6]).
Furthermore, most of these predictions rely either on a single sum-
score from self-assessed surveys or one self-reported depression
status [30], with Pearson ùëü ranging between 0.15 and 0.35, or often
fall into a binary classification (depression versus not depression
with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)
values around 0.7 [1]).
2.2
Depression Symptoms Prediction
Few studies analyzed depression at the symptom level using social
media language. For example, [64] used a semi-supervised statisti-
cal model to profile depression using texts (i.e., tweets) from Twitter
to emulate the nine symptoms from the PHQ-9 questionnaire (e.g.,
lack of interest). Their results also found overlapping LDA topics
(sacrificing specificity) across symptoms of depression due to inher-
ent comorbidity. A similar approach was also proposed to match
tweets to their corresponding PHQ-9 categories in [39]. However,
validation of machine learning models in most symptom-level stud-
ies relies on expert annotations rather than self-assessments of lived
experiences. Though the classic survey like PHQ-9 could reflect
the DSM classifications of depression to some extent, using only
one scale may be insufficient for profiling symptoms of depression
due to well-known differences across scales [22, 24]. Therefore, in
this study, we identify differential language markers of various
depression symptoms on Reddit and validate them on an indepen-
dent sample of Facebook users who provided a diverse array of
self-assessments on their symptoms.

2.3
Mental Health and Reddit
Reddit, a popular semi-anonymous online discussion forum, con-
tains different communities (i.e., subreddits). Reddit is widely used
to discuss mental health concerns and seek community support. Pre-
vious studies have characterized the language of health conditions
using Reddit including mental health [27] and physical health [61].
For example, [25] mapped subreddits to the best-matching DSM-5
category using a multiclass classifier. In the 54 papers reviewed
by [9] on depression and anxiety investigation using Reddit, ap-
proximately two-thirds of studies used language extracted from
Reddit as the basis for predictive mental health classifications. Apart
from identifying linguistic markers of specific conditions, Reddit
has also been used to predict changes in mental health status. For
instance, [14] used posts from the same users on Reddit to pre-
dict future suicidal ideation. They studied the shifts from mental
health-related discourse to suicide-related posts and it was found
that linguistic cues about esteem and network support were linked
to reducing such a shift.

METHODS
3.1
Data
3.1.1
Depression Symptoms. In this study, 13 symptoms of de-
pression (see in Table 1) were derived from a larger set of 52 sub-
symptoms compiled from the seven most frequently used depres-
sion assessments in psychology and psychiatry literature, such as
the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; [5]), the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HRSD; [31]), and Center of Epidemiologi-
cal Scales (CES-D; [17]). A trained psychologist categorized the 52
symptoms based on their similarities and comorbidities, resulting
in the 13 symptoms used in this study, which two clinical experts
further validated.
3.1.2
Reddit. We used the PushShift Reddit dataset [4], which
includes posts from January 2010 to December 2019, to identify
subreddits discussing different symptoms. Based on prior works [15,
27], we categorized the depression-related subreddits to our 13
symptoms labels and expanded the list to include subreddits that
used the names of the 13 symptoms we selected (e.g., r/Anger for
the anger symptom). We then assessed a random set of 50 posts to
confirm the relevance of the discussions to the symptom.
Following prior work [27], we created a control dataset of the
same users, consisting of posts from non-depression-related subred-
dits. We collected 1,318,749 Reddit posts across the 13 depression
symptoms and the control dataset. We excluded comments on posts
to limit the scope of the data to describe the experience of symp-
toms, as comments often contain a mix of offering support while
discussing symptoms. The study was deemed exempt by the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.
Descriptive statistics on the dataset at the symptom level are
provided in Table 1, including the subreddits used to collect posts
for each symptom. Additionally, anhedonia, concentration deficit,
fatigue, sad mood, and worthlessness had relatively few posts from
the listed subreddits. We gathered extra posts pertaining to these
symptoms by conducting a keyword search using the name and
core descriptions of each symptom within the subreddits, including
r/AskReddit, r/lonely, r/CasualConversation, r/SeriousConversation,
r/depression, r/self, r/ADHD, r/Advice, and r/NoStupidQuestions.
Finally, we excluded posts with fewer than 10 words from our
analyses.
3.1.3
Facebook: We obtained Facebook status updates from a sam-
ple of 2,986 individuals who consented to share their Facebook
data and responded to depression, anxiety, and loneliness self-
assessment survey instruments. Depression was assessed using the
PHQ-9 [38], anxiety was assessed by General Anxiety Disorder-7
(GAD-7) [58], and loneliness was assessed by the UCLA-3 item [32].
We calculated sum scores for each scale as the user‚Äôs depression,
anxiety, and loneliness scores. Individuals were enrolled through
the Qualtrics Panel, an online crowdsourcing platform for research
participants‚Äô recruitment. Of these individuals, 69.7% identified
as female and the mean age was 43 yrs (SD: 12), and 63.8% had
a Bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher. This data analysis was exempted
by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board, see
more details about this data in [41]. We used this Facebook data for
validating the models built on Reddit data.

3.2
Language Features
We tokenized every post using happierfuntokenizer from the DLATK
Python library [56] and masked specific tokens, such as URLs into
meta tags. We then extracted four different features that were shown
in prior literature [15, 30, 43] to have significant associations with
mental health: a) psycho-linguistic lexicon - Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count 2015 (LIWC) [48], b) open-vocabulary topics gener-
ated from latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [7], and c) RoBERTa
embeddings [42].
3.2.1
LIWC:. We utilized the expert-curated LIWC lexicon which
consists of different psycholinguistic categories and associated
words for each category. We counted the tokens in each post that
match the tokens in the LIWC dictionary [49] and then normalized
the counts by the number of words in the post to obtain the relative
frequency of each LIWC category.
3.2.2
Reddit Topics: After removing the top 100 most frequent
words in the Reddit dataset as stop words, we applied LDA [7] to
identify topics in the posts. LDA is a probabilistic generative model
that assumes posts are generated by a combination of topics, and
topics are distributions of words. Given that the words within a post
are known, it is possible to estimate topics as latent variables using
Gibbs sampling. We used the MALLET implementation of LDA [44]
to generate 200 topics, with an alpha level of 5. We obtained the
distribution of each topic for all posts in the Reddit dataset.
3.2.3
RoBERTa embedding. We used RoBERTA [42], a pre-trained
contextual word embedding model, to generate numeric vector rep-
resentations of posts‚Äô language. RoBERTa embedding of each word
depends on the other words used near it, so these models capture
contextual semantic information in a language unlike other co-
occurrence or count-based methods. To calculate post embeddings,
we averaged representations for each word in the post, where a
word is represented by its 10ùë°‚Ñé layer in the RoBERTa model. We
used roberta-base from transformers [63] to compute embeddings.
3.2.4
Facebook Topics: Using a similar process for generating Red-
dit topics, we generated 500 topics on the Facebook dataset. We then
obtained the probability distributions of the 500 topics for every
user in the Facebook dataset. We also obtained the distribution of
Facebook topics for every Reddit post to build a symptom-level pre-
dictive model. Prior work has found that LDA topics are sensitive
to the domain in which they are trained and applied [3, 11]; hence,
we also considered the Facebook topics as a candidate feature set
in validating the Reddit models on PHQ-9, GAD-7, and UCLA-3
self-assessments from the Facebook dataset.
3.3
Differential Language Markers of
Depression Symptoms
After we obtained the language features in the above section, we
performed a differential language analysis to identify statistically
significant correlations between the features and the symptom la-
bels. We designed this as a post-level analysis and used two sets
of language features (LIWC and Reddit topics, respectively) as in-
dependent variables in the logistic regression model to predict the
symptom labels of each post. This was set up as a one-vs-all classi-
fication task where, for instance, when obtaining language markers
for anger, posts in the subreddits belonging to anger were given
the outcome of 1, and posts in all other subreddits (Control + other
depression symptoms) were given the dummy outcome of 0. These
dummy outcomes were the dependent variables when training the
logistic regression models. In this analysis, we wanted to study the
specific language markers of each symptom compared to the control
+ all other symptoms. Based on conventional linguistic analysis, we
used a ùëù-value of < 0.01 to identify significant linguistic markers,
and all ùëù-values were corrected for the false discovery rate during
multiple hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni correction.
3.4
Prediction Models for Depression Symptoms
Considering the dimensionality of our feature set, we trained Ran-
dom Forest classifiers on Reddit language to predict depression
symptoms. We treated each linguistic feature set (LIWC, Reddit
Topics, RoBERTa embeddings, and Facebook Topics) as an indepen-
dent variable and treated the exact symptom labels as dependent
variables in predictive models. Each feature set was considered
independently to enable a comparative analysis of their predictive
performance. In the predictive analyses, we trained two models: 1)
symptom vs. control, and 2) symptom vs control + all other symp-
toms. We provide the results from the second set of models (aimed
at higher specificity) in the Appendix. The models were evaluated
using 5-fold cross-validation, and we report AUC on the test set
estimates from the 5-folds.
3.5
Validation on PHQ-9, GAD-7, and UCLA-3
self-assessments
We applied the Reddit models to language features extracted from a
different sample of Facebook users who took the depression (PHQ-
9), anxiety (GAD-7), and loneliness (UCLA-3) survey assessments to
see if they could generalize to out-of-sample, out-of-platform, and
a different source-label dataset. We included anxiety and loneliness
survey assessments here for two reasons. First, anxiety and loneli-
ness are often considered sub-symptoms of depression [20, 59], and
we can fully capture the variance in the manifestations of depres-
sion symptoms by including them in validation. Second, general
anxiety and loneliness are also comorbid with depression [16, 20],
which could generate substantial impairment in functioning for the
depression diagnosis.
As discussed in the next section, Reddit topics and RoBERTa ob-
tained the best performance in the within-sample cross-validation
analyses. Therefore, we extracted these feature sets at the user level
from Facebook data. We then trained a classifier using each linguis-
tic feature set (LIWC, Reddit Topics, Facebook Topics, and RoBERTa
embeddings) as an independent variable and distantly supervised
symptom labels (i.e., the exact symptom label from Reddit data) as
a dependent variable.
After the Reddit classifiers were trained, we applied them to the
Facebook dataset to generate user-level predictions of depression
symptoms, which provided inferred estimates (probabilities from
the classification models) of 13 depression symptoms. To validate
the predictive utility of these estimates, we assessed their perfor-
mance using Spearman correlations. We correlate the probabilities

RESULTS
4.1
Differential Language Markers of
Depression Symptoms
As illustrated in Figure 2, we identified different linguistic markers
across symptoms from LIWC and Reddit Topics. The symptom of
suicidal thoughts and attempts (hereinafter referred to as suicide) is
strongly associated with LIWC Death (OR: 3.602), and topics about
self-harm ("scars," "cuts," OR: 1.662) and death ("die," "death," "sui-
cide"; OR: 1.762). Anxiety is marked by LIWC Anxiety (OR: 3.022)
and topics about panic and anxiety ("panic," "anxiety," "attack"; OR:
1.9461). Disordered eating is positively linked to LIWC Ingestion (OR:
1.617) and binge eating-related topics ("eat," "binge," "calories"; OR:
1.617). Loneliness is positively linked to LIWC Friends (OR: 1.230)
and dating-related topics. Unlike the above symptoms, anger, anhe-
donia, concentration deficit, and fatigue do not show clear profiles
of language associations.
Our analysis reveals that it is possible to identify clusters of
symptoms based on their language profiles. Interestingly, most of
these symptom clusters could be mapped to the five domains of the
Research Domain Criteria (RDoc) framework [33]. This framework
aims to organize biological and behavioral manifestations of mental
health across different domains, as shown in the Appendix Table
A1.
The clearest cluster contained disordered eating, sleep problem,
and somatic complaints. These three symptoms exhibit similar
language profiles, as they are all associated with a higher likelihood
of using LIWC categories such as ingestion, body, health, and time.
As might be expected, each of these three symptoms is also marked
by direct symptom mentions. For example, sleep problem is linked
to topics about sleep ("sleep," "night"; OR: 2.359), and sleep-related
ingredients and supplements ("cbd," "oil"; OR: 1.291). Somatic com-
plaint is associated with LIWC perceptual processes (OR: 1.077) and
topics such as stomach-related illness ("ibs," "stomach"; OR: 3.371),
other physical symptoms related to hearing ("tinnitus," "ear"; OR:
1.289) and body pain ("pain," "neck," "leg"; OR: 1.739). It is worth
noting that some hearing-related physical diseases are linked to af-
fective disorders in the literature (e.g., Tinnitus [54]). The language
profiles of these three symptoms also exhibit some differences.
While somatic complaint is positively associated with sleep-related
language (e.g., "sleep," "asleep," "night"; OR: 1.036), disordered eating
shows a negative association with such language. Additionally, dis-
ordered eating is less likely to discuss topics related to panic and
anxiety medications (e.g., alprazolam or "xanax"; OR: 0.978).
The symptoms of suicide and anxiety exhibit similar language
patterns. Both are associated with increased use of language re-
flecting negative emotions, health, and friends. Additionally, they
are linked to decreased use of language related to social processes,
affiliation, ingestion, leisure activities, and personal interests (e.g.,
games). Apart from the language related to death and harm men-
tioned earlier, the language associated with suicide also includes
anger-related words (LIWC Anger, OR: 1.342; "angry," "control,"
"mad," OR: 1.191), negations (OR: 1.481), 1st person singular pro-
nouns (OR: 1.640), and sadness (OR: 1.264). Furthermore, individu-
als exhibiting suicidal tendencies are more likely to discuss feeling
sorry about their loved ones ("you," "love," "sorry"; OR: 1.515).

When comparing these two symptoms, it is important to note
that anxiety is associated with more language about anxiety (as
mentioned earlier), body (OR: 1.137), work (OR: 1.035), and topics
related to fear ("fear," "worry"; OR: 2.686), while suicide is negatively
associated with them. On the other hand, anxiety is associated with
less language about negations (OR: 0.905), death (OR: 0.863), and
sadness (OR: 0.901), whereas suicide is more likely to use or mention
these language markers.
Loneliness, worthlessness, sad mood, and self-loathing are
four symptoms share similar language patterns. They share a ten-
dency to discuss topics related to negative emotions and social
aspects (e.g., affiliation), while being less likely to mention death,
sleep, anxiety, pain, and medication.
It is important to note that although the four symptoms men-
tioned above include discussions about eating, they tend to use
language from the LIWC ingestion category less frequently (OR:
[0.955, 0.971]), which covers a wider range of vocabulary. Loneliness
is more closely linked to discussions about dating and relationships
("girls," "date"; OR: 1.937), which may be related to the demographics
of Reddit users (e.g., young men). Unlike the other three symptoms,
sad mood is less associated with the language of achievement (OR:
0.988), and worthlessness is uniquely more linked to language about
money (OR: 1.021).

Prediction Models for Depression Symptoms
Table 2 and Appendix Table A2 show the within-sample cross-
validation results of Random Forest models trained using three
feature sets: LIWC, Reddit Topics, and RoBERTa for identifying
the symptoms of Reddit posts. Table 2 shows the results of each
symptom against control, and Table A2 shows the results of each
symptom against all other symptoms + control.
The highest AUC across three models for the same symptom
is presented in bold. In Table 2, we see that the model utilizing
RoBERTa embeddings demonstrates the highest accuracy for most
symptoms, except for sleep problem and somatic complaint. Ad-
ditionally, it also achieves the highest accuracy for the two core
symptoms in DSM-5‚Äìanhedonia and sad mood, indicating the su-
perior predictive power compared to all three models. The model
using Reddit topics has the largest accuracy (.982 for sleep problem).

Validation on PHQ-9, GAD-7, and UCLA-3
self-assessments
As shown in table 3, most of the language-predicted symptoms were
significantly associated with self-reported mental health surveys‚Äì
except fatigue (the non-significant coefficients at ùëù-value of 0.05
are grayed out). Overall, the symptom estimates from linguistic
features extracted using RoBERTa embeddings have the strongest
correlations with the survey scores. Because most of the symp-
tom estimates reached the highest accuracy when estimated using
RoBERTa embeddings, we only report the RoBERTa results in Table
3.
Language-estimated suicide (ùúå = 0.234), self-loathing (ùúå = 0.236),
disordered eating (ùúå = 0.214), and loneliness (ùúå = 0.206) show the
strongest correlations with self-reported depression (all ùëù < 0.001).
This is consistent with these symptoms being among the strongest
language markers on the Reddit data. The correlations between
language-estimated fatigue and self-reported depression and anxi-
ety scores are insignificant.
Similar to our findings with language markers, language-based
anhedonia, worthlessness, and concentration deficit have weaker
correlations with all three self-reported scales. The correlations
between somatic complaint and all three self-reported scales are
weaker, particularly when correlating with anxiety, although they
remain significant. In contrast to the challenges in identifying mark-
ers of anger on Reddit, we found robust positive correlations be-
tween the estimated anger using RoBERTa and self-reported de-
pression, anxiety, and loneliness on this Facebook dataset.
To evaluate the robustness of the language-based symptom pre-
dictions compared to all the self-reported symptoms measured
by the PHQ, we conducted a correlation analysis between the
RoBERTa-estimated symptoms and the nine individual items of
the PHQ-9, as shown in Table 4. We found that suicide, self-loathing,
loneliness, and disordered eating have robust, significant correlations
with all nine items (all ùúå > 0.08). Moreover, consistent with findings
in the above sections, anhedonia, concentration deficit, fatigue, and
worthlessness have weaker or non-significant correlations across
all items.

Note: All correlations are Spearman correlations. Non-significant correlations are grayed out. All other correlations are significant at ùëù < 0.05.
Even though we did not include a specific language-estimated
symptom to reflect slow movement (PHQ item 8), we observed that
this item correlated with many symptoms but in opposite directions
(e.g., positively correlated with suicide, ùúå = 0.158, but negatively
correlated with fatigue, ùúå = -0.081). The four negative correlations
found with PHQ 8 are associated with symptoms with less distinct
language markers, namely anhedonia, concentration deficit, fatigue,
and worthlessness. In addition, we observe that the largest correla-
tions for many PHQ items do not stem from their corresponding
symptom language estimates. For example, PHQ 3 (sleep issues)
has the strongest correlations with language-estimated suicide (ùúå =
0.178), instead of the language-estimated sleep problem (ùúå = 0.144).
This indicates that language-based depression symptom prediction
from Reddit may generalize across symptoms, but at the cost of
specificity.

DISCUSSION
The current paper (1) determined the language profiles of 13 expert-
validated symptoms of depression on Reddit, (2) evaluated the pre-
dictive performance of four different linguistic feature sets (LIWC,
Reddit Topics, RoBERTa embeddings, and Facebook Topics), and
(3) validated the generalizability of Reddit language in predicting
depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and loneliness (UCLA-3) sur-
vey assessments on an out-of-sample dataset of 2,986 Facebook
users. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of
the symptom prediction models against the PHQ symptoms.
One significant finding from our study is that suicidal ideation,
self-loathing, disordered eating, and loneliness have more robust
language markers on Reddit than other symptoms. This pattern
is consistent in the subsequent predictions and validations using
Facebook data. This pattern can be explained from two perspectives.
First, from a theoretical perspective, these symptoms have well-
documented individual manifestations, and the links between these
symptoms and the severity of depression are strong. Depression is
often associated with a high suicide risk rate (e.g., around 15%; [46])
and is highly correlated with eating disorders and loneliness [2, 62].
Depression has also been linked to increased self-focus and self-
criticism [51]. Anxiety, which has its own unique manifestations
and is highly correlated with depression, also demonstrated clear
language patterns in our findings.
Second, from a measurement perspective, these symptoms may
be more easily detected through language use on social media. Past
investigations of depression-related language features have identi-
fied top linguistic features associated with these symptoms [26, 30,
34, 55]. For example, depression has been linked to higher use of
the first-person singular [13]. Additionally, eating-related topics are
among the largest topics derived from depression-related Twitter
language [52].
Another key finding is that Reddit provides a cost-effective
method for detecting depression symptoms accurately. Language
features extracted from Reddit show high accuracy in our predic-
tion and validation analyses. Such high accuracy can be attributed
to the use of language features extracted from Reddit posts, which
are analyzed at the post level to predict the forum membership of
each post, and are in line with [27]. Our study is unique compared
to past research analyzing Reddit language, as clinical experts vali-
dated our depression symptoms. Moreover, while not all symptoms
were easily detected in language, over half of the symptoms in our
study demonstrated satisfactory validity on a different dataset with
self-reported item-level and instrument-level measures.
5.1
Limitations
One of the limitations of this study, which can also be considered a
strength in terms of rigor, is that we applied validation to a differ-
ent sample across platforms (i.e., from Reddit to Facebook). This
approach reduces the transfer learning capability but increases the
external validity of our results. We did not explore domain adap-
tation techniques that could yield higher correlation coefficients
on the target domain, as seen in prior works [29, 35]. Second, in
the validation study, we only correlated with individual items from
180
WebSci ‚Äô23, April 30‚ÄìMay 01, 2023, Austin, TX, USA
the PHQ-9 which measures 9 symptoms of depression. To better
capture the multidimensional nature of depression, future studies
should consider additional scales that capture a wider range of
symptom dimensions. Third, due to the limited number of posts
on Reddit for some symptoms (e.g., anger, worthlessness), we added
posts generated from keyword searches to increase the data size.
This may have introduced noise into our language-based estimates,
even though the AUCs for prediction are high and comparable to
the other symptoms. Especially for four symptoms, fatigue, concen-
tration deficit, anhedonia, and worthlessness, it was challenging to
collect sufficient language data from Reddit to identify their clear
language markers. Future research could investigate the language
manifestations of these symptoms further.
5.2
Ethical Considerations
The current study is a secondary data analysis of de-identified Red-
dit and Facebook data. The Facebook language data were collected
from human subjects and approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB). Analysis of social media language and mental health
conditions needs careful ethical considerations. First, individuals‚Äô
social media posts are highly sensitive and can contain Personal
Identifiable Information (PII). This data set was carefully collected
and stored in a secure location and could only be accessed by re-
searchers on relevant projects after undergoing human subjects
training and being added to the IRB protocols. On the one hand, it
can inform the development of interventions and reduce the risks
associated with mental health disorders. On the other hand, it can
create biases and propagate stigma toward individuals with these
disorders if used improperly. Further, while the participants on
Reddit accepted the platform ToS that the data is publicly avail-
able did not explicitly consent to their data being used for research
purposes [50]. Therefore, using social media language-based men-
tal health indicators should involve inputs from multi-disciplinary
stakeholders, including participants, computer scientists, psycholo-
gists, medical professionals, ethicists, and others. This would ensure
the approach is ethical and respectful of individual privacy and men-
tal health.
